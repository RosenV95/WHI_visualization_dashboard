An interactive Dash-Plotly visual dashboard for the World Happines Index, based on data from https://worldhappiness.report/. To run it you need python >=3.7 and all the libs in the requirements.txt, which can be installed by running:
- $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Depending on your set up you might also need to run:

- $ jupyter lab build

The main logic of the dashboard is in the 2IMV20-2-26-final.ipynb


The datapreproccessing.ipynb is just a file where the data preprocessing is done and can be used to provide insight on the process. It is not needed to run the interactive  tool.
