An interactive Dash-Plotly visual dashboard for the World Happines Index, based on data from https://worldhappiness.report/. To run it you need python >=3.7 and all the libs in the requirements.txt, which can be installed by running
- pip install -r requirements.txt
The main logic of the dashboard is in the 2IMV20-2-26-final.ipynb

Depending on your set up you might also need to run $ jupyter lab build

The datapreproccessing.ipynb is just a file where we did our data preprocessing and can be used to provide insight on the process. It is not needed to run the interactive  tool.
